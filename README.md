OpenGL playground/template.

# Usage

Only buildable on linux, and I doubt it is very compatible with any linux install not mine.

```
# Uncomment the debug #defines in ./src/include/util.h for console output.
$ make
$ cd ./build # Required (for now) for the shaders to be found at runtime.
$ ./opengl-pg
```
